Low-level programming refers to the practice of writing software that interacts directly with the hardware of a computer, bypassing high-level abstractions and interfaces provided by operating systems and other software layers. In other words, low-level programming is writing code that is closer to the machine level and requires a deep understanding of the underlying computer architecture.

Low-level programming languages like Assembly, C, and C++ allow programmers to access the hardware of a computer in a very detailed and specific way. For example, they can write code that directly manipulates registers and memory addresses, which can be used to optimize performance and create very efficient code. However, low-level programming can also be more complex and error-prone than high-level programming, as the programmer must manage details like memory allocation and deallocation manually. Low-level programming is often used in situations where performance is critical, such as in embedded systems, operating systems, and device drivers. It is also used in security research and exploit development, as understanding the low-level details of a system is essential for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities. However, for most general-purpose programming tasks, high-level programming languages like Python, Java, and Ruby are more commonly used, as they offer higher-level abstractions and are generally easier to use and maintain.
